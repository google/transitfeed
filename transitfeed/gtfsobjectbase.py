  """Object with arbitrary attributes which may be added to a schedule.

  This class should be used as the base class for GTFS objects which may
  be stored in a Schedule. It defines some methods for reading and writing
  attributes. If self._schedule is None than the object is not in a Schedule.

  Subclasses must:
  * define an __init__ method which sets the _schedule member to None or a
    weakref to a Schedule
  * set the _TABLE_NAME class variable to a name such as 'stops', 'agency', ...
  * override the _REQUIRED_FIELD_NAMES, _FIELD_NAMES and _DEPRECATED_FIELD_NAMES
    variables according to the needs of the GTFS object
  * define methods to validate objects of that type:
    * ValidateBeforeAdd, which is called before an object is added to a
      Schedule. With the default loader the object is added to the Schedule if
      this function returns True, and is not added if it returns False.
    * ValidateAfterAdd, which is called after an object is added to a Schedule.
      With the default Loader the return value, if any, is not used.
